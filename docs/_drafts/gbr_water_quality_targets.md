title: GBR Water Quality Targets
---

The water quality targets for dissolved inorganic nitrogen, fine sediment (which is measured as total suspended 
solids), particulate phosphorus and particulate nitrogen provide an unprecedented level of scientific understanding 
into what is required from the catchments to support Reef health.

Below is a list of water quality target reports that are derived from [Water Quality Scenarios](/research/water_quality_scenarios).
