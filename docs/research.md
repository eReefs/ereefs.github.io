The eReefs Platform is based on a number of research components which include remote sensing tools as well as a number of marine models, fine scale coastal relocatable models as well as catchment models.

eReefs integrates marine hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models with catchment models and satellite data to provide high-frequency information on physical and biological processes at multiple scale, such as:

- Sediment and nutrient dynamics

- Plankton blooms dynamics and dispersal

- Flood plumes and dispersal of pollutants

- Water quality, marine heat waves, warming and acidification

The accuracy of eReefs models is supported by data collected through both routine in-situ monitoring and satellite earth observations.
