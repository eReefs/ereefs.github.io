title: Biogeochemical model
---

The CSIRO Environmental Modelling Suite (EMS) has been developed over 20 years to model
coupled physical, sediment, chemical and biogeochemical processes in marine and estuarine envi-
ronments (https://research.csiro.au/cem/projects/). Recently the biogeochemical model has been significantly improved through the addition of a spectrally-resolved optical model and a number of new biogeochemical processes (carbon chemistry, coral processes, multiple seagrass species etc).

Ecological processes are organised into three zones with pelagic processes including phytoplankton and zooplankton growth and mortality, detritus remineralisation and fluxes of dissolved oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus. Coral Macroalgae and seagrass growth and mortality are included in the epibenthic zone, whilst further phytoplankton mortality, microphytobenthos (benthic diatom) growth, detrital remineralisation and fluxes of dissolved substances are included in the sediment layer.
