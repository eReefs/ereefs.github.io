The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), Australia's tropical marine research agency, brings significant research expertise in monitoring and ecological responses, deep data stores and modelling knowledge to the eReefs partnership.

The development of routinely operating, data assimilating models of the circulation and water quality within the Great Barrier Reef has been a shared vision for more than a decade. AIMS sees eReefs as the realisation of this vision, and believes that the modelling and visualisation tools developed will not only advance many areas of science but increase the certainty of scientific advice provided to stakeholders in relation to some of the most challenging issues affecting the Reef.
