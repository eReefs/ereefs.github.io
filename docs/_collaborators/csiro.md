CSIRO is Australia's national research agency. CSIRO provides the knowledge to help manage Australiaâ€™s oceans and atmospheric environment, to plan for and respond to weather and climate related natural hazards, and to ensure sustainable coastal development and growth of marine industries. It delivers practical and collaborative science that enables governments, industries and communities to make informed decisions to preserve and protect natural treasures such as the Great Barrier Reef.

CSIRO is undertaking initiatives to transform ocean information management, which will enhance Australia's capacity to address national ocean-related information challenges and opportunities. eReefs forms part of this initiative.
