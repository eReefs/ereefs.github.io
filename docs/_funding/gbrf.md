The Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF) is fostering a resilient reef for all generations by catalysing and funding science that informs, encourages and inspires. They aim to promote a strategic, collaborative and coordinated approach with their partners in business, government, and philanthropy to fund essential research that delivers meaningful outcomes for managers, users and policy makers.

The Foundation was the custodian of the *eReefs* vision from its inception.  As a part of their broader research portfolio, they provided guidance, coordination and funding for the *eReefs* collaboration from its beginnings as a pilot hydrodynamic model in 2009, until the modelling suite and web plabform reached full operational status in 2024.

For the first major collaborative phase of *eReefs* development between 2012 and 2015, GBRF secured an initial $5M investment from BHP which was leveraged with $4.9M from the Science Industry Endowment Fund (SIEF), $8M from the Australian and Queensland Governments, and $16M co-investment from research institutions, including CSIRO, AIMS and the Bureau of Meteorology.

Three more research phases followed with GBRF support: in 2016 to 2017, 2018 to 2020 and 2021 to 2024. The last of these was funded via the [Integrated Monitoring and Reporting](https://www.barrierreef.org/what-we-do/reef-trust-partnership/integrated-monitoring-and-reporting) component of the [Reef Trust Partnership](https://barrierreef.org/what-we-do/reef-trust-partnership) between GBRF and the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy (DEE).
