The Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) and its preceeding entities have supported the eReefs collaboration since its inception.

From 2012 to 2016, the Australian Government Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (SEWPAC) matched the Queensland Government's funding for the development of the *eReefs* Platform  via the [Caring for our Country](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/land/landcare/past-programs/caring-for-country) initiative and the [Reef Rescue Program](https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20120318193507/http://www.environment.gov.au/about/grants/pubs/grants-report-dec11.pdf).

In 2014, the Australian Government [committed to providing the initial $40 million investment](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/media/pressrel/3126498/upload_binary/3126498.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22media/pressrel/3126498%22) which established the [Reef Trust](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/protecting/our-investments/reef-trust), to be jointly coordinated by the Australian Government Department of the Environment (DE), the Queensland Government Department of the Environment and Heritage Protection (DEH), and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) with advice from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).   The *Reef Trust* is the funding body for the [Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/protecting/reef-2050-plan), of which a key component is the
[Reef 2050 Plan Reef Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program (RIMReP)](https://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/programs-and-projects/reef-2050-integrated-monitoring-and-reporting-program), which has funded the *eReefs* collaboration since 2016.

From 2018 until 2024, *Reef Trust* funding and communications support for the *eReefs* were administered by the *Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF)* as part of the [Integrated Monitoring and Reporting](https://www.barrierreef.org/what-we-do/reef-trust-partnership/integrated-monitoring-and-reporting) component of the [Reef Trust Partnership](https://barrierreef.org/what-we-do/reef-trust-partnership) agreement between GBRF and the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy (DEE).

From 2025 onwards, *eReefs* has been directly supported by DCCEEW.
