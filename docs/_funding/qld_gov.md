In addition to their research participation and co-investment in the *eReefs* collaboration, the the Queensland Government has directly invested more than $3 million in the *eReefs* project.

Their initial contribution for $1 million for 2014/15, was followed by an [additional $2 million over two years](https://documents.parliament.qld.gov.au/speeches/spk2015/Steven_Miles-Mount%20Coot-tha-20150715-591299205351.pdf) (2015/16 and 2016/17) which supported the completion
of the near-real-timee marine water quality modelling work in the first major development phase of the *eReefs* collaboration.

The goal of this grant was to ensure that *eReefs* will use the latest technologies to collate and analyse data with new and integrated marine
monitoring and modelling to produce understanding, prediction, visualisation, communication and reporting tools that span the entire reef
from catchment to ocean.   Those integrated tools, in turn, will help the government to plan and assess the results of its investment in
land management practices, and in particular whether the associated improvements in the quality of water flowing to the Great Barrier Reef
will protect reef ecosystems.
