Researchers from the Queensland Government Department of the Environment, Tourism, Science and Innovation (DETSI) operate a [Great Barrier Reef Catchment model](/research/catchment_model) based on the [eWater Source](https://ewater.org.au/ewater-solutions/tools/source/) catchment modelling framework.  This model is part of the [Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting](https://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/tracking-progress/paddock-to-reef) component of the [Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan](https://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/water-quality-and-the-reef/the-plan), and its results have been used as the river forcing dataset for *eReefs* marine model hindcast datasets.

In addition to the catchment model, DETSI operate a [network of in-situ water quality monitoring stations](https://water-monitoring.information.qld.gov.au/) throughout the Great Barrier Reef catchments which *eReefs* depends on as a source of streamflow forcing data for the near-real-time *eReefs* model datasets.
