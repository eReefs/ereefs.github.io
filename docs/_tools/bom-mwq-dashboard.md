title: Marine Water Quality Dashboard
---
This website was hosted by the Bureau of Meteorology, and enabled access to near real-time data on sea surface temperatures, chlorophyll levels, sediments and light for the entire Great Barrier Reef.

The data products available via this website included ocean colour datasets derived from MODIS satellite observations using an algorithm developed by CSIRO as part of eReefs phase 2. 

The dashboard was decommissioned in December 2020, but the Marine Water Quality data is still available from the [Bureau of Meteorology’s data catalog](http://ereeftds.bom.gov.au/ereefs/tds/catalog/ereef/mwq/catalog.html) and may be visualised in [CSIRO’s eReefs Data Explorer](https://portal.ereefs.info/).
