The Bureau of Meteorology is developing real time catchment and marine forecast models to simulate a range of physical and water quality processes across the Great Barrier Reef. These systems will provide short term forecasts of water conditions to support tactical decision making of a range of stakeholders. The first eReefs product known as the Marine Water Quality Dashboard is live on our website and provides ready access to the most up to date water quality monitoring across the Great Barrier Reef.

Active involvement in the eReefs project is one of the many ways the Bureau is fulfilling its mission to provide Australians with the information they need to manage and live within their natural environment, encompassing the atmosphere, oceans, water and land, as outlined in our Marine Strategy 2014 – 2019. The eReefs products form part of a growing suite of new data services developed under the National Plan for Environmental Information Initiative. This initiative is providing connected data services to enhance the discovery, sharing, use and reuse of environmental information. It is jointly managed by the Bureau of Meteorology and Department of the Environment.
