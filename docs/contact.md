# Trying to contact us?

As eReefs is a long-term research collaboration, there are several different points of contact depending on which information you are looking for:

## eReefs Community Forum

If you are a researcher working with eReefs data sources and tools, we invite you to join the [eReefs Community Forum](https://forum.ereefs.info).  

Announcements about new eReefs platform tools and features are made there, and it's a great space to ask for help or advice from other community members as well as from the eReefs research teams.
