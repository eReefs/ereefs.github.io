Spanning a history of over 90 years, the Science and Industry Endowment Fund (SIEF) provides grants to science and scientists for the purposes of assisting Australian industry, furthering the interests of the Australian community and contributing to the achievement of Australian national objectives. This unique and esteemed funding arrangement received a substantial gift from CSIRO made possible from proceeds of its fast wireless local area network (WLAN) technology, facilitating the rejuvenated Fund to be a mechanism for significant support of science in Australia.

Providing substantial grants available across the National Innovation System, the Fund supports a portfolio of activities including: 17 Research Projects to the value of over AU$75 million; Research Infrastructure worth AU$30 million; Special Research Projects in excess of AU$13m; as well as a commitment of over AU$19 million until 2020 for Promotion of Science in the form of Postdoctoral Fellowships, Postgraduate and Undergraduate Scholarships, a Chair in Wireless communication at Macquarie University, Lindau Fellowships and the STEM+ Business Fellowships.
