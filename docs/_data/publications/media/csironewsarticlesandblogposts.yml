      Deteriorating water quality is one of the biggest
      threats to the Great Barrier Reef. Vital protection
      and recovery efforts are taking place in the
      catchments adjoining this national treasure’s coastline.

      The Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia’s most
      diverse and unique landscapes. Covering more than
      2,900 individual reefs, it is home to unmatched
      marine biodiversity. A multidisciplinary group
      of researchers from Australia’s national science
      agency, CSIRO, have been working on projects using
      innovative science and technology to help combat
      some of the threats facing our reef. Meet the
      team and learn more about their work here.

      New research indicates that when coral colonies
      on the Great Barrier Reef spawn more than once
      a year, reefs receive a more consistent supply
      of coral larvae which could help coral recovery
      and the resilience of the Reef.

      While underwater drones, robots and satellites
      have a well-earned place in monitoring the
      state of our oceans and climate, we also
      look to ship-based measurements for
      first-rate data.
