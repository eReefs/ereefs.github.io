The BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) contributed $5 million ($1 million per year over five years) to the first major collaborative phase of eReefs development between 2012 and 2016. This contribution was an example of BMA's commitment to key support activities for the Reef and to the [broader sustainability activities in Queensland](https://www.bhp.com/-/media/bhp/documents/investors/reports/2014/bhpbillitonourcontribution2014.pdf).

The funding support [extended an existing relationship between BHP Billiton and BMA with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation](https://www.bhp.com/news/articles/2015/05/new-7-million-partnership-to-help-protect-great-barrier-reef).
