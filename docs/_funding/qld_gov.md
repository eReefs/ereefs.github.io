The Queensland Government has invested more than $3 million in the eReefs project which will link with the highly innovative Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program. eReefs will use the latest technologies to collate and analyse data with new and integrated marine monitoring and modelling to produce understanding, prediction, visualisation, communication and reporting tools that span the entire reef from catchment to ocean. It will help the government to plan and assess the results of its investment in land management practices, in particular whether the associated improvements in the quality of water flowing to the Great Barrier Reef will protect reef ecosystems.
