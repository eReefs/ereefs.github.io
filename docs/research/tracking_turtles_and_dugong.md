# Tracking Turtles and Dugong

## Summary
Monitoring the location, population size and habitat use by turtles and dugong is critical to their effective conservation.

## eReefs Products used
- GBR4 and GBR1 hydro and BGC hindcasts 
- Visualisation Portal

## Outcomes and Impact
- As part of dugong aerial surveys researchers are using the eReefs hydrodynamic model to find the height of the water at each dugong observation 
- Researchers studying the fine-scale habitat use of green turtles in the Gladstone region rely on eReefs to provide information about environmental conditions that might be driving their behaviour.
