CSIRO's *Environmental Modelling Suite (EMS)* is the software used to generate the eReefs GBR4, GBR1 and RECOM data products.
EMS includes the C code for CSIRO's Sparse Hydrodynamic Ocean Code (SHOC) hydrodynamic model and the related river-tracer and biogeochemistry and sediments models.

EMS was created by [CSIRO's Coastal Environmental Modelling team](https://research.csiro.au/cem/) and has been reused in many applications in addition to *eReefs*. It is freely available for [re-use under an open-source license](https://github.com/csiro-coasts/EMS/blob/master/LICENSE.md), with users encouraged to [register with the EMS development team](https://research.csiro.au/cem/software/ems/ems-user-registration/) for additional assistance and updates.
