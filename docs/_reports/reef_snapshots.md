Summer is a critical time for coral. The snapshot provides a summary of conditions on the Great Barrier Reef (the Reef) 
throughout summer, how these conditions impact coral and actions underway to help coral reefs. The snapshot focuses 
on coral. The health of other habitats or species is not assessed, although this may be added in future snapshots. 
Each year, towards the end of summer, the snapshot is prepared by the three main Australian Government agencies 
responsible for Reef management and science: the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (Reef Authority), 
Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), and CSIRO. This snapshot is based on the latest information available 
at the time of writing. It does not take the place of ongoing rigorous reporting by all agencies. It sets the scene 
for the more comprehensive reports released later in the year. These include the mid-year Long-Term Monitoring Program 
reports by AIMS, and reports from the Marine Monitoring Program managed by the Reef Authority.
