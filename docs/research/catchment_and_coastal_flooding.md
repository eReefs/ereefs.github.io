# Catchment and Coastal flooding

## Summary
Freshwater plumes entering the GBR lagoon may extend to the reef matrix, carrying pollutants from the land, suspended sediment, and water with lower salinity, thus directly affecting the reef ecosystem. Mapping freshwater extents over time and space would allow for an improved management of the GBR.
