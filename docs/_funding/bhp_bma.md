BMA is contributing $5 million ($1 million per year over five years) to support the delivery of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation's eReefs project, assisting in the protection and preservation of the Reef.

The company's contribution is an example of BMA's commitment to key support activities for the Reef and our commitment to the broader sustainability activities in Queensland.

The funding support extends an existing relationship between BHP Billiton and BMA with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.
