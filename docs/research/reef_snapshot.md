title: GBRMPA Reef Snapshot Reports
---
The Reef snapshot provides a summary of conditions on the Great Barrier Reef throughout summer, and how these conditions impact coral and Reef health and the actions being taken to help coral health.

The snapshot is a joint initiative of the Australian Governmentâ€™s lead management and science agencies for the Great Barrier Reef, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and CSIRO.

The snapshot is based on the latest available science and information at the time of writing.

It sets the scene for more comprehensive reports later in the year, such as the mid-year Long-term Monitoring Program reports by the Australian Institute of Marine Science and Marine Monitoring Program reports by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.

The snapshot provides a point-in-time summary of Reef health monitoring conducted each year.

The eReefs project provides the Reef temperature exposure data for use in developing the Reef snapshot reports.
