title: Data Assimilation
---

The optically complex waters of the GBR contain mixtures of white carbonate and brown non-carbonate suspended sediments, green microalgae, colour dissolved organic matter and a reflective bottom visible in optically shallow water from a surface view. Here we use a bio-optical model to simultaneously assimilate multi-spectral remote-sensing reflectance observations from MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP and OLCI Sentinel-3A/B (19 bands in total) into a coupled physical-biogeochemical model of the Great Barrier Reef region using a 100-member Ensemble Kalman Filter. The multi-spectral approach allows the assimilation system to update the differing constituents simultaneously, achieving a reduction in system errors when compared to withheld in-situ observations.  Schematic of the eReefs marine modelling system illustrating the modelling and observational products that are assembled to generate the data assimilating ensemble simulations. Model runs implemented on the National Computing Infrastructure. Aggregate outputs are used for GBR water quality report cards.
