Spanning a history of over 90 years, the Science and Industry Endowment Fund (SIEF) provides grants to science and scientists for the purposes of assisting Australian industry, furthering the interests of the Australian community and contributing to the achievement of Australian national objectives. This unique and esteemed funding arrangement received a substantial gift from CSIRO made possible from proceeds of its fast wireless local area network (WLAN) technology, facilitating the rejuvenated Fund to be a mechanism for significant support of science in Australia.

In 2010, SIEF [granted Round One funding of $4 million over five years](https://sief.org.au/csiro-gift/what-has-been-funded/what-has-been-funded-research-projects-program/) to the early stages of the eReefs collaboration under the project title [e-Reefs â€“ Transforming the Science and Management of the Great Barrier Reef](https://sief.org.au/csiro-gift/what-has-been-funded/what-has-been-funded-research-projects-program/ereefs-research-project/).
