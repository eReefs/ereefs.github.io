The Australian Government has supported *eReefs* since its inception.

From 2025 onwards, *eReefs* is directly funded by the [Australian Government Reef Trust](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/protecting/our-investments/reef-trust).

From 2018 until 2024, *Reef Trust* support for the *eReefs* were administered by the *Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF)* as part of the [Integrated Monitoring and Reporting](https://www.barrierreef.org/what-we-do/reef-trust-partnership/integrated-monitoring-and-reporting) component of the [Reef Trust Partnership](https://barrierreef.org/what-we-do/reef-trust-partnership) agreement between GBRF and the Australian Government.

In 2016, the Reef Trust committed further funding to *eReefs* under the Reef Trust Partnership.

From 2012 to 2016, the Australian Government matched the Queensland Government's funding for the development of the *eReefs* Platform  via the [Caring for our Country](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/land/landcare/past-programs/caring-for-country) initiative and the [Reef Rescue Program](https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20120318193507/http://www.environment.gov.au/about/grants/pubs/grants-report-dec11.pdf).
