In Phase 5 of eReefs, the Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) developed water quantity and quality catchment models and systems to generate the historical simulations and real-time status updates. Streamflow and water quality concentration and load at hourly time scale was generated for all Great Barrier Reef gauged and ungauged catchments. These simulations were used as input to 69 marine model nodes for eReefs Phase 5 project. The real-time system was developed by the Bureau and deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) before being delivered to CSIRO to run operationally. The historical simulation system (streamflow only) was developed using National Computational Infrastructure (NCI). These systems are capable of providing historical and real-time information on water quantity and quality to support the tactical decision-making for a range of stakeholders. Although the Bureau is not directly contributing to eReefs Phase 6, they will continue ongoing collaborations with eReefs partners on scientific publications, and additionally support CSIRO to operate the real-time and historical systems until June 2025.

The Bureau was actively involved in the eReefs project from Phase 2 and delivered significant capability from the Water Quality Dashboard and ReefTemp, to the recent streamflow and water quality simulation systems. Providing trusted, reliable and responsive weather, water, climate, ocean and space weather services for Australia – all day, every day.
