title: RRAP Coral Bleaching Model
---
This is a Matlab version of the C-language coral bleaching model from the [CSIRO Environmental Modelling Suite (EMS)](https://research.csiro.au/cem/software/ems/).

It contains a mechanistic model of the coral-symbiont relationship that considers temperature-mediated build-up of reactive oxygen species due to excess light, leading to zooxanthellae expulsion. The model explicitly represents the coral host biomass, as well as zooxanthellae biomass, intracellular pigment concentration, nutrient status, and the state of reaction centres and the xanthophyll cycle.

This software was created as an output of the [Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP)](https://gbrrestoration.org/) and is freely reusable under a [MIT Licence](https://github.com/gbrrestoration/coral-bleaching-model/blob/main/LICENSE).
