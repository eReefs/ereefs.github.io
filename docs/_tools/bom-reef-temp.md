The *ReefTemp Next Generation* Website was an operational high-resolution daily satellite sea surface temperature (SST) monitoring tool for the Great Barrier Reef.

It was created and hosted by the Bureau of Meteorology, launched in October 2013, and used [high-resolution SST data produced by the Intergrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)](https://imos.org.au/srs-sst-data) to produce maps of:
- Daily Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
- SST Anomalies (deviation from average SST)
- Degree Heating Days (thermal stress accumulation over summer)
- Mean Positive Summer Anomaly (Average thermal stress over summer)

These data products and maps were used on a daily to weekly basis year-round by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) to manage coral bleaching risk on the reef.

The *ReefTemp Next Generation* website was decommissioned in 2024 when the Bureau of Meteorology stepped back from active participation in the *eReefs* collaboration, but the [IMOS SST data](https://imos.org.au/srs-sst-data) remains freely available online, and is available for visualisation in the [eReefs Data Explorer](https://portal.ereefs.info/map) (search for layers with names including 'GHRSST').
