title: Sediment transport
---

The sediment transport model adds a multilayer sediment bed to the hydrodynamic model grid and simulates the sinking, deposition, and resuspension of multiple size classes of suspended sediment (Gravel, Sand, Mud, Fine Sediment, and Dust). The sediment model is forced by reanalysis of the Australian wide waves prediction model.
