The eReefs Platform is based on the number of research components which include remote sensing tools as well as a number of near real-time models, such as marine models, fine scale coastal relocatable models as well as catchment models.

Building on and integrating a variety of critical data inputs, the eReefs tools and the data they generate can be discovered based on an innovative central information infrastructure reflecting best practice in environmental information management.

Ultimately, through the selective mobilisation of eReefs tools and specific interrogation of eReefs data, a range of services tailored to the specific needs of users, managers and policy makers can be delivered covering incident response, forecasting, scenario modelling as well as reporting and communication.
