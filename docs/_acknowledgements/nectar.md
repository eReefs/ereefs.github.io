Web hosting for the [*eReefs* Data Explorer](https://portal.ereefs.info/map) and related web application has been supported by the Nectar Research Cloud and by the [Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF)](https://www.qcif.edu.au/) and [Monash University](https://research.monash.edu/en/equipments/research-cloud) Nectar node operators since 2014.

The Nectar Research Cloud is a collaborative Australian research platform supported by the [NCRIS](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris)-funded [Australian Research Data Commons](http://ardc.edu.au/) (ARDC).

In 2024, the ARDC published a case study about 10 years of history with the eReefs platform:  [Protecting the Great Barrier Reef with eReefs, Powered by Nectar](https://ardc.edu.au/case-study/protecting-the-great-barrier-reef-with-ereefs-powered-by-nectar/).
