The Great Barrier Reef Foundation is fostering a resilient reef for all generations by catalysing and funding science that informs, encourages and inspires. Promoting a strategic, collaborative and coordinated approach, together with our partners in business, government, and philanthropy, the Foundation has so far raised more than $50m for essential research that delivers meaningful outcomes for managers, users and policy makers.

The Foundation is custodian of the eReefs vision, as part of its broader research portfolio and has guided the development of the project from its inception.
